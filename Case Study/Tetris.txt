Tetris
-------
There are seven pieces in standard Tetris. Each standard piece is composed of four blocks. A Tetris field is essentially a big 
collection of stones, some representing empty fields, and some representing parts of a Tetris block, either just falling or 
landed at the bottom of the play ground some time ago. Whenever a block lands, it dissembles into its individual stones, which 
are considered independent from then on. It makes sense, therefore, to represent each stone by an individual object in an 
object-oriented Tetris application. Doing so naively results in a large amount of objects being allocated, deleted, and moved 
all the time.  

Expected Output
----------------
Design a class strucutre for Tetris.
Optimize memory, taking advantage of the fact that the stones are really very similar

Event-driven simulator
------------------------

Design a generic event-driven simulator, i.e. a simulator skeleton that may simulate a wide range of systems. The simulator 
contains a queue of events and a variable indicating the simulated time. Each event has a time stamp that indicates the time 
at which the event will occur. The queue contains events, which are sorted in the ascending order of the time at which the 
events occur.

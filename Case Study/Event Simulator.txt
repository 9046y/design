Event-driven simulator
------------------------
If events aren't guaranteed to occur at regular intervals, and we don't have a good bound on the time step, then it's more
appropriate to use an event-driven simulation. A typical example might be simulating a lineup at a bank, where customers don't 
arrive at regular time intervals, and may be deterred by a long lineup.This approach uses a list of events that occur at 
various time, and handles them in order of increasing time. 

Here is a generic event-driven algorithm:
1. Initialize event list
2. While (simulation not finished)
3.   Remove first event from list, 
4.   handle it
6.   Set time to the time of this event.

Design a generic event-driven simulator. The simulator contains a queue of events and a variable indicating the simulated 
time. Each event has a time stamp that indicates the time at which the event will occur. The queue contains events, which are 
sorted in the ascending order of the time at which the events occur.

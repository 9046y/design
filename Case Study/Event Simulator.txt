Event-driven simulator
------------------------
If events aren't guaranteed to occur at regular intervals, and we don't have a good bound on the time step, then it's more
appropriate to use an event-driven simulation. A typical example might be simulating a lineup at a bank, where customers don't 
arrive at regular time intervals, and may be deterred by a long lineup.This approach uses a list of events that occur at 
various time, and handles them in order of increasing time. 

Here is a generic event-driven algorithm:
1. Initialize events
2. While (simulation not finished)
3.   get next event 
4.   handle it
6.   Set time to the time of this event.

Design a generic event-driven simulator. 
1. The simulator contains all the events. 
2. Each event has a time stamp that indicates the time at which the event will occur. 
3. The Simulator performs action for the event
4. The events are in the order of increasing time.


Expected Output:
Design a class structure for a Event Driven Simulator.
